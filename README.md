## Challenge Description
1.  **Your visualization must include a Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).**  
2.  **Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:**  
	- **A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)**  
		- Used Tableau API integration
	- **A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly**  
		- Tableau used to visualize data
	- **A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data**  
		- We have multiple pages with different dashboards
	- **A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)** 
		- N/A
3.  **Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.**
	- We chose to use the Tableau API library
4.  **Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.**  
    Ours has over 100,000 records.
5.  **Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).**  
    Tableau makes our viz interactive.
6. **Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.**  
	We each focused on creating visualizations after thorough dialogue about our data results.
